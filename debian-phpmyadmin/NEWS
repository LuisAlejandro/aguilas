phpmyadmin (4:3.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  phpMyAdmin now uses dbconfig-common for configuring control user and
  phpmyadmin auxiliary databases. If you have used custom configuration, you
  might need to merge it with the one shipped in package or at least use
  generated password from /etc/phpmyadmin/config-db.php.
